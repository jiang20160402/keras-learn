# Neural networks and deep learning

## 1. Why sigmoid neuron

>    Small changes in the weights and bias cause only a small change in the output. That's the crucial fact which will allow a network of neurons to learn.

> The definition of sigmoid function:
   $$\sigma \equiv \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + e^{-z} } \qquad z \equiv w \cdot x + b $$
